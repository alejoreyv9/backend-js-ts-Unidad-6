## About :octocat:

:alien: **Author:** presentations were made by Norbey Danilo Muñoz Cañón. Some presentations have material taken from peers and teachers. Thanks to them for making the knowledge and material universal.

:smiley_cat: **Ack:** presentations contain notes from the web, books and content from authors who make their material and knowledge freely available on the web.
